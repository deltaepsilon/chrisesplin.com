JavaScript Promises are a prerequisite for productivity with the Firebase JavaScript SDK. Firebase does support callbacks, but Promises are so much cleaner and easier to read!


## Read the Docs

You know a spec is good when the docs are this concise: [MDN Promise Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

Promises are a way to avoid ðŸ‘¹ðŸ‘¹ðŸ‘¹ [CALLBACK HELL](http://callbackhell.com/) ðŸ‘¹ðŸ‘¹ðŸ‘¹. You know youâ€™ve done it.


## Cut down those Promise trees!

Firebase emits promises, so most of the time you wonâ€™t have to create your own, youâ€™ll just consume the Promise API that Firebase produces. A typical bit of code might look like this.


The bit of code above is something that I use in production to handle the checkout process for my shopping cart. Itâ€™s the most critical bit of code in my entire app and, therefore, livelihood. Every *CheckoutService* function returns a Promise, so I can chain them and avoid callback hell.

Notice how the *checkout* function has **9** asynchronous steps? Node.js relies on asynchronous operations for performance reasons. Node.js has only one thread, and you do **not** want to block it with a synchronous operation that takes more than a few milliseconds. The browser is similar, so any sophisticated use of JavaScript is going to end up with a lot of async operations.

Anyway, the key to understanding promises, is to recognize that theyâ€™re just a fancy, flat way of handling callbacks. Theyâ€™re just callbacks. Thatâ€™s it.

## Roll Your Own

To make this abundantly clear, letâ€™s roll a promise of our own.


This example has a function named *waitForIt. waitForIt* takes an argument *N* and waits *N* milliseconds before continuing. *waitForIt* returns a Promise. The Promise takes an *executor* function, which has two arguments, *resolve*, and *reject*. The *executor* function then uses *setTimeout* to wait *N* milliseconds before calling *resolve.*

Because *waitForIt* returns a Promise, we can register callbacks against that Promise using *.then()*. The beauty of *.then()* is that it can return itâ€™s own Promise, which can then register its own *.then()* callback.

## Getting Fancy

Read through the following example to see some of the fun stuff that Promises can do.


* Lines 1â€“3 are a new Promise that waits 1000 milliseconds before resolving itself with the number *10*.

* Lines 4â€“7 receive the number *10* from the earlier promise and immediately returns a resolves promise using *Promise.resolve()*;

* Lines 8â€“11 do the exact same thing as the previous *.then()* callback, but they donâ€™t wrap the result in *Promise.resolve()*. Returning a value out of a *.then()* callback and returning *Promise.resolve()* has the same result.

* Lines 12â€“21 are the fanciest yet. They use *Promise.all()* to take an array of 10 Promises and wait for all of them to resolve before continuing on. *Promise.all()* itself returns a Promise, and that Promise resolves with an array of itâ€™s child Promisesâ€™ results. See line 23.

* Lines 22â€“25 logs out the array of results from the previous Promise and then throws a rejection with *Promise.reject()*;

* Lines 26â€“28 will never execute, because an earlier link in the *.then() *chain returned a rejected Promise.

* Lines 29â€“31 will catch the rejected Promise in the preceding chain and log it out.

## Firebase Promises

The Firebase JavaScript SDK uses Promises. Youâ€™ll see them everywhere, but just to give you a taste, check out this chunk of code.


This file relies on two libraries that both emit Promises, *firebase *and *axios*. The code uses *axios* to get a list of Star Wars characters from the Star Wars APIâ€”[SWAPI](http://swapi.co/api/people/)â€”and save them to Firebase. It also queries the Firebase collection via the Firebase REST API to get a JSON list of the saved Star Wars characters.

## Thatâ€™s All Folks

Thereâ€™s not much more to Promises. Itâ€™s a small API, and youâ€™ll use it a lot, so [read the docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), get comfortable with using Promises instead of callbacks, and let me know if you have any questions!
