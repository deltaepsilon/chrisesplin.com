### Project Summary

I'm a [Google Developer Expert for Firebase](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-chris_esplin).

I've been teaching Firebase since the early days of [DevMountain](https://devmountain.com/) in 2014 . Firebase I've flown all over the world to participate in Firebase conferences and help build the community.

Full-Stack Firebase is my online Firebase course. It's a repository of my Firebase best practices, and it includes a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-firebase/) with 2.5 hours of video content.

### Technology

Full-Stack Firebase is all about Firebase for web with React as the front-end framework.

I spent most of my time learning Adobe's Creative Suite, primarily Premiere, Photoshop and Audition.
