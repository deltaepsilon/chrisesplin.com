### Project Summary

I built Colossal to enable multi-channel marketing/messaging across a variety of platforms.

Publishers create feeds and ask their followers to subscribe to those feeds. Subscribers choose where they receive the feed. Initial channel support includes

- email
- sms
- native web + Android
- Facebook Messenger
- Slack
- Twitter DMs

###  Technology

I used Firebase and Google Cloud Platform extensively. 

- Data is stored in Firestore and the Firebase Realtime Database (RTDB). 
- Logging is fed into BigQuery. 
- Google Cloud Build handles CI/CD.

The front end is [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

I love Next! The routing and static rendering are my favorite parts. I get so sick of complex routing with `react-router`. Next is a great project and I can't sing its praises enough.
