### Project Summary

My YouTube adventures were short-lived. I could go back to publishing to YouTube, but my corpus of ~40 videos is doing fine and continuing to get plenty of views.

I use YouTube to teach Firebase as part of my role as a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-chris_esplin).

I started out with longer, lightly-edited screencasts and progressed to short, scripted clips.

I preferred the shorter clips, but viewers appear to prefer the longer, more stream-of-conciousness screencasts... so I'm not sure what to do with my channel. Plenty of Firebase learners love to learn via video, so my YouTube videos continue to earn views and are achieving their long-tail purpose of teaching Firebase while I sleep.

### Technology

So much Adobe Premiere.
