### Project Summary

I take pride in my ability to pixel-match my UX to a designer's mocks.

[XScope](https://xscopeapp.com/) is my preferred toolkit for mock matching. It's been a standby for my since I discovered it in 2012.

I do a lot of dev on a custom Win10 box that I built a few years back, and XScope is NOT Win10-compatible.

Pixels is a Chrome Extension that replicates some of my favorite XScope functionality in the browser.

### Technology

Pixels relies on full control of the browser window through Chrome's extension APIs.

Everything worked great in local development, but I ran into permissions problems as soon as I tried to publish to Chrome's Extensions store.

I abandoned the project. The core extension code still works "ok", but I couldn't achieve a smooth install process.
