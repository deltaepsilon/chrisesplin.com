### Project Summary

Bunches is a knock-off of the game [SET](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/set)

I played a bunch of SET when I was working at Pluralsight. It's a pattern-matching card game with a steep learning curve.

I've got a strange attraction to HTML5 games. I don't play them... I just daydream about building them.

Bunches is a full implementation of SET with some fun multiplayer features.

### Technology

Bunches is all React and HTML5 Canvas.

The core game logic is written as a single JavaScript module. The rest of the app implements that module and uses Canvas to draw the cards.
