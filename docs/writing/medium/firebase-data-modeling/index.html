          <h3>Model data for performant Firebase apps</h3>
<p>Firebase provides very little guidance on how to structure your unstructured JSON data. Firebase provides push keys and dis-incentivizes us from using numbered list keys… but that’s it. The rest of your data model is up to you.</p>
<p>Let’s review a few best practices that will make your Firebase experience fun and fresh.</p>
<h3>Normalization / Shallow data structures</h3>
<p>Most JSON data structures are completely denormalized, meaning that we don’t tend to use references with JSON. That tendency is easy to carry over to Firebase, but that’s a mistake!</p>
<p>Firebase is happiest when you keep your data structures shallow, and you’ll need to normalize your data to achieve that. Let’s review two example data structures. First, the slow and inefficient… deeply-nested data.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following examples use keys such as <em>product1</em> or <em>transaction2</em> for convenience in creating and reading example data structures. In a production application we would use push keys generated by <em>someRef.push()</em>. For example, a common product or transaction id would look like <em>+M0H4sFUOPe1vgQSXkWqdA==</em> rather than <em>product1</em> or <em>transaction2</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Data &lt;anti-pattern alert!!!&gt;</strong></p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;users&quot;: {
        &quot;user1&quot;: {
            &quot;email&quot;: &quot;[user1@gmail.com](mailto:user1@gmail.com)&quot;,
            &quot;transactions&quot;: {
                &quot;transaction1&quot;: {
                    &quot;total&quot;: &quot;500&quot;,
                    &quot;products&quot;: {
                        &quot;product1&quot;: &quot;paper airplanes&quot;,
                        &quot;product2&quot;: &quot;tooth picks&quot;
                    }
                },
                &quot;transaction2&quot;: {
                    &quot;total&quot;: &quot;250&quot;,
                    &quot;products&quot;: {
                        &quot;product1&quot;: &quot;rocks and dirt&quot;,
                        &quot;product2&quot;: &quot;spatulas&quot;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice in the previous data structure how every user attribute contains all of it’s children. It has an email address and a collection of transactions. This model is inefficient, because I can’t loop through all of my users and just pull the email addresses. I can pull an individual user’s email address efficiently with Firebase, but I can’t pull <strong>just</strong> email addresses for a group of users. If I needed to loop through 1000 users, I would have to request all of those users’ transactions along with their email addresses.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the happier, shallow data structure:</p>
<p><strong>Shallow Data</strong></p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;users&quot;: {
        &quot;user1&quot;: {
            &quot;email&quot;: &quot;[user1@gmail.com](mailto:user1@gmail.com)&quot;
        }
    },
    &quot;transactions&quot;: {
        &quot;user1&quot;: {
            &quot;transaction1&quot;: {
                &quot;total&quot;: &quot;500&quot;,
                &quot;products&quot;: {
                    &quot;product1&quot;: &quot;paper airplanes&quot;,
                    &quot;product2&quot;: &quot;tooth picks&quot;
                }
            },
            &quot;transaction2&quot;: {
                &quot;total&quot;: &quot;250&quot;,
                &quot;products&quot;: {
                    &quot;product1&quot;: &quot;rocks and dirt&quot;,
                    &quot;product2&quot;: &quot;spatulas&quot;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how the <em>/users/user1</em> attribute has only one child node, the user’s email address. The user’s transactions are still accessible via <em>transactions/user1</em>, but I can efficiently loop through my users’ email addresses without pulling down excess data.</p>
<p>The downside to shallow data structures is that I occasionally need to create a second ref to pull in transactions… they’re not available on my <em>users/{userId}</em> ref…</p>
<p><strong>Using two refs to join data</strong></p>
<p>We have to constantly balance normalization (shallow structures) vs denormalization (deep structure) based on how we want to use our data.</p>
<p>If we find that we’re regularly pulling email addresses along with transactions, we may need to duplicate the users’ email addresses in the transactions like this:</p>
<pre><code>
…
“transaction1”: {
 “email”: “[user1@gmail.com](mailto:user1@gmail.com)”,
 “total”: “500”,
 “products”: {
 “product1”: “paper airplanes”,
 “product2”: “tooth picks”
 }
}
…
</code></pre>
<p>Don’t be afraid of duplicating data to speed up your reads. Yes, duplicating data can slow your writes a bit and can be obnoxious to manage, but duplicate data will enable your apps to scale effortlessly to millions of reads.</p>
<h3>Stream your data</h3>
<p>Modeling your data as streams provides great scalability and prevents large queries that slow down your Firebase.</p>
<p>Consider a data structure for a chat application:</p>
<pre><code>**Structured Chat Data**

{
 “userChats”: {
   “user1”: {
     “chat1”: {
       “message”: “First!”
     },
     “chat2”: {
       “message”: “I’m still here…”
     }
   },
   “user2”: {
     “chat1”: {
       “message”: “Hey user one.”
     },
     “chat2”: {
       “message”: “Where did you go?”
     }
   }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The structured chat data above is too deeply nested. You’ll have difficulty querying this data, because Firebase can only query on one child node at a time, and it can’t be a “grandchild” node… it must be a direct child of the list’s top level. In this case, you can’t query the <em>userChats</em> node because none of it’s direct children are values, they’re all nested nodes.</p>
<p>Now let’s consider a flatter structure:</p>
<p><strong>Stream Chat Data</strong></p>
<pre><code>{
 “chats”: {
   “chat1”: {
     “user”: “user1”,
     “username”: “Chris”,
     “message”: “First!”
   },
   “chat2”: {
     “user”: “user2”,
     “username”: “Melissa”,
     “message”: “Hey user one.”
   },
   “chat3”: {
     “user”: “user2”,
     “username”: “Melissa”,
     “message”: “Where did you go?”
   },
   “chat4”: {
     “user”: “user1”,
     “username”: “Chris”,
     “message”: “I’m still here…”
   }
 }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case we’ve named the top node “chats”, and we’ve duplicated the user ids and usernames for each chat. We can now query the <em>chats/</em> node on the <em>user</em> like so:</p>
<p>We can also listen to the <em>child_added</em> event to add chats to our UI:</p>
<p>Make sure to structure your data as streams whenever possible, meaning long, shallow lists of data. Don’t nest any more than is necessary for your needs. Also, do not be afraid to duplicate data such as usernames, user ids, object titles, etc. Try to match your data structure to your UI. In the previous example, each “chat” object must have the username attached to it, because attempting to join usernames to chats would be incredibly expensive.</p>
<h3>Prefer child_added events to value events</h3>
<p>Firebase provides two primary event types for retrieving your data, <em>value</em> and <em>child_added</em>. The <em>value</em> event returns all child nodes in an unsorted JSON object and then returns all nodes every time there’s any change to any of the child nodes. The <em>child_added</em> event fires once for each existing child and then fires again every time a child is added. Since <em>child_added</em> fires once for every child, it can respect query <em>orderBy</em>* parameters.</p>
<p>Most beginning Firebase users initially prefer the <em>value</em> event because it’s so easy to reason about; however, more sophisticated users tend to use <em>child_added</em> wherever possible, because <em>child_added</em> places less load on the server running your Firebase, so it scales better. Also, since <em>child_added</em> respects sort order, you don’t have to manually sort the data on your client.</p>
<h3>Queues FTW</h3>
<p>We tend to think about Firebase as a front-end, client-side technology, but it provides a great architecture for highly-scalable server processes: Queues!</p>
<p>Firebase integrates with Google Cloud Functions to create lightweight Node.js tasks that are fired off by adding items to a Firebase list. Users can add jobs to a queue and your Cloud Functions can listen to that queue, process the job, remove the job from the queue and even add another job to a different queue for further processing.</p>
<p>The following example illustrates a simple queue data structure that takes proposed username changes and proposed shopping cart checkouts from users. In this example user1 has requested a username change and user2 has requested a shopping cart checkout. The server has already approved a username change for user3 and has added it to the <em>serverQueues/updateUsername/</em> node for further processing. The server has also approved a <em>userQueues/cartCheckout</em> job for user4 and has added user4’s credit card to the <em>serverQueues/chargeCard</em> node for payment processing.</p>
<p><strong>Queues Example</strong></p>
<pre><code>{
 “userQueues”: {
   “changeUsername”: {
     “user1”: {
       “proposedUsername”: “T-Rex”
     }
   },
   “cartCheckout”: {
     “user2”: {
       “total”: 750,
       “products”: {
         “somePushKey”: “tongue depressors”,
         “anotherPushKey”: “deoderant”
       }
     }
   }
 },
 “serverQueues”: {
   “updateUsername”: {
     “somePushKey”: {
       “user”: “user3”,
       “username”: “Charlie”
     }
   },
   “chargeCard”: {
     “somePushKey”: {
       “user”: “user4”,
       “total”: 250,
       “cartToken”: “1234asdf”
     }
   }
 }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how the <em>userQueues/changeUsername/$user</em> node and the <em>userQueues/cartCheckout/$user</em> node use each user’s id as child keys? We would typically use fresh, new push keys for a list like this, but these nodes have to be user-writeable so that our clients can add jobs to the queues. By using the user id as the child key, we can write a security rule to enforce that users must be authenticated and can only queue one job at a time:</p>
<pre><code>{
 “rules”: {
   “userQueues”: {
     “$queueName”: {
       “$userId”: {
         “.write”: “auth.uid == $userId”
       }
     }
   }
 }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The security rules statement above grants write privileges to any user whose auth uid matches the user id for <em>usersQueues/$queueName/$userId</em>. Security rules default both read and write privileges to false. Security rules match by node name, but also allow wildcard node names that begin with <em>$</em>. So in this case, we’re adding a rule to <em>userQueues</em> followed by a wildcard <em>$queueName</em> and a wildcard <em>$userId</em>. The rule grants write access to the <em>userQueues/$queueName/$userId</em> node if the user is authenticated and the user’s authentication uid matches the node name. So if your auth uid is <em>user6</em>, you <strong>can</strong> write to <em>usersQueues/changeUsername/user6</em> or <em>usersQueues/cartCheckout/user6</em> or <em>usersQueues/anyOtherQueueName/user6</em>. However, <em>user6</em> cannot write to <em>userQueues/changeUsername/user7</em>, because the <em>user7</em> part of the path does not match <em>user6</em>’s uid: <em>user6</em>.</p>
<p>In practice, these uids are much longer than the ids we’ve used in this example: <em>user1</em> and <em>user2</em>. These keys are determined programmatically by Firebase Authentication and look like long, encoded strings such as <em>WQ3mVT7f8pRbBmry6eZju1Z4lPi1</em>.</p>
<p>All nodes in this data structure are available to the server with full read/write privileges, which has admin privileges through it’s <em>/service-account.json</em> api key. So users can add one job at a time to their <em>userQueues/$queueName/$userId</em> nodes, but only the server can add jobs to the <em>serverQueues/</em> data tree.</p>

<p>Why might you want to use shared keys in your data model?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When might you want to duplicate parts of your data?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grab a piece of paper or create a <em>.json</em> file and sketch out a potential data structure for a basic to-do app. Try to be creative and realistic.
— Do you have user objects? If so, what attributes do users need?
— What attributes would you use for each to-do item, and how would you relate to-dos to users?
— Would you duplicate some data across objects?
— Will the resulting data structure scale well, or will you have trouble reading nested data?</p>
