        <div className="medium-content">
          <p>You probably haven’t heard of it, because it’s buried in one of the “getting started” guides in the Firebase docs and nobody reads ALL OF THE DOCS!</p>
<p>I only discovered <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims">custom claims </a>when I complained about the lack of user role management.</p>
<p>I mean, if I want to tag a user as an admin, do I have to make a database entry? Because if that’s the case, I have to query the database every time I authenticate a user and while I’ve done that for a long time… it’s a slow, cumbersome operation.</p>
<p>So I was whining, I can’t remember if it was online or at a Firebase event and a Firebase team member mentioned Custom Claims as an easy solution to my problem.</p>
<p>Why is this feature hidden!!!</p>
<p>Every Firebase app should be using Custom Claims, and it’s buried deep in the docs!</p>
<p>Any non-trivial app eventually needs user roles. I need to mark users as administrators or managers or moderators or just plain paid-up users. And Custom Claims allows me to set simple user attributes directly on my user’s JWT.</p>
<p>A JWT is a Json Web Token, which is the <strong>currentUser</strong> object in Firebase Authentication.</p>
<p>So every time I authenticate on the client I get a currentUser JWT, and if I’ve set custom claims on my user, I can extract the custom claims from the user JWT.</p>
<p>I have a sample Cloud Function that does just this, <a href="https://github.com/deltaepsilon/firebase-ssr-starter/blob/master/functions/src/authorization-on-create.js">so check out that link</a>.</p>
<p>So let’s talk through that code and I’ll show it all in action.</p>
<p>We’ll get started with my Cloud Function called <strong>authorizationOnCreate</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>authorizationOnCreate</strong> is triggered by new user creation in Firebase Authentication.</p>
<p>I’m saving all of my custom claims data by user email address in the Realtime Database, so the first thing to do is to get that data from the RTDB.</p>
<p>Once I have the relevant claims data for my user, I just need to set it.</p>
<p>That’s an easy call to <strong>firebase.auth.setCustomUserClaims()</strong>.</p>
<p>I just pass in the user’s UID that I get from the JWT and the claims object.</p>
<p>The claims object can be anything really, but it must be under 1000 bytes, and you should only use it for access-control.</p>
<p>There are performance implications to trying to save too much data in a custom claim, so just follow best-practices and keep that sort of data in the RTDB or Firestore.</p>
<p>In this case I want to set <strong>isAdmin</strong> and <strong>isModerator</strong> flags on my user.</p>
<p>I developed this Cloud Function with test-driven development methodologies, so I am very proud to say that it worked the very first time I deployed it.</p>
<p>To prove that this works, I’ll go ahead and delete my user from Firebase Authentication.</p>
<p>Now I’ll register a new user and we can see that the claims are not there yet.</p>
<p>I can refresh my page and the claims still won’t be there…</p>
<p>…so I’ll have to sign out and sign back in…</p>
<p>…and there they are.</p>
<p>My <strong>isAdmin</strong> and <strong>isModerator</strong> flags are set and I’m ready to start writing my admin dashboard.</p>
<p>I’m getting my custom claims data by calling <strong>currentUser.getIdTokenResult()</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s an async function that returns an <strong>idTokenResult</strong>. The <strong>idTokenResult</strong> has a claims attribute with the custom claims as children.</p>
<p>Getting and setting custom claims is dead simple. All of the complexity comes from writing the Cloud Function to do it, so go ahead and copy/paste my function to get started!</p>
<p>I write very opinionated Cloud Functions code… so take my code with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>You don’t need to complicate your Cloud Functions as much as I do.</p>
<p>Go ahead and keep it simple, and I hope you love custom claims.</p>
<p>They’re fantastic.</p>
<p>I’m just mad that it took me so long to find them.</p>
