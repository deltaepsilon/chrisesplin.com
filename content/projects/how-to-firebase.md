### Project Summary

I'm a [Google Developer Expert for Firebase](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-chris_esplin) or GDE for short.

My GDE role centers around publishing Firebase-related content. [HowToFirebase.com](https://howtofirebase.com/) is a series of Medium articles teaching Firebase basics.

Medium is great for discovery, but it puts a paywall up in front of my content, so I no longer publish to Medium.

### Technology

How To Firebase covers basic Firebase best practices starting in 2016. Most of the articles are older and cover older practices.

[Full Stack Firebase](https://www.fullstackfirebase.com/) is my follow-up that covers the Firebase APIs as of 2018.
